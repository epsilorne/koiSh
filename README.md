# koiSh

A toy shell, written mainly to learn the innards of how OSes work.

Other doco TBA.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/epsilorne/koiSh.git
cd koiSh
make
./bin/koish
```

## Known Issues:
- Piping input into `koish` breaks things

## TODO:
- Command history
- Piping and redirecting
- Environment variables
- `.config` file (e.g. for customisable prompt and aliases)
- Autocompletion
- Anything else that might be useful for a shell
